If the LSM9DSU is plugged into the 3.3V line , SDA, SCL, and the upper of the two gnd pins on the left side of the 
redboard, the board fails and stops responding.


Debugging:

When shield is plugged in, Tx stops and board goes unresponsive. Tx begins when shield unplugged

using jumpers to individually plug in each line. When A5 plugged in and uno reset, tx stops
A5 is the problem!!

Made a comment here.  I'm trying out the git hubs.
